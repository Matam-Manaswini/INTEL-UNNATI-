Me & my team were part of INTEL UNNATI 2024 Program and we had been given with problem statement: Cryptography Simulation with mbedTLS/OpenSSL Library Usage and 
User Interaction.

Objective: To develop an interactive simulation of cryptographic techniques using C code and mbedTLS/OpenSSL, 
enabling users to understand and experiment with different aspects of cryptography, including 
encryption, decryption, key generation, and cryptographic algorithms.

The proposed solution is an interactive simulation tool using OpenSSL libraries in C to help users experiment with encryption, decryption, and key generation. This hands-on tool enhances the understanding of cryptographic techniques, making learning accessible and practical for students and professionals.

Unique Idea Brief (Solution):Develop an interactive tool that allows users to engage with encryption, decryption, and key generation processes. This tool provides hands-on experience and practical learning in cryptography.

Features Offered: Implementation of algorithms like RSA, AES, DES, and SHA , User input for encryption and decryption processes., Simulation of cryptographic key generation and management and User-friendly interface 

Technologies Used: C Programming Language and OpenSSL Libraries

Conclusion: The tool serves as an educational resource for understanding and experimenting with cryptography, valuable for students and professionals in cybersecurity. It facilitates a hands-on experience with cryptographic concepts, aiding in comprehending how cryptography secures digital communication and data.
